You are free to use all libraries. We want clear cumminication, meaning that the comments of pushes must be explaining and intuitive. And so must also the variables, functions, classes, and other code elements. We expect you to use the same styling as us, meaning colors and style. We will of course look it through and edit the styling, but if you can make it looke like out styling, you are making a great impression!
